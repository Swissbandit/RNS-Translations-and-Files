## A Welcome 

# Especially for the Nontechies among our friends

So you just became Wind of Reticulum,

read some of its Technicals and Docs,

now decided to try out [Sideband]?

ok,good.

Here is a short Introduction for Firsttime Users

# Gratulations

All the technical stuff did not deter you from 
wanting to try this out now for yourself,

and in fact you dont have to know much 
about how it will all works 
in order to start using it,

the best part about it; 

Reticulum is doing all of its work 
automaticly for you,

all you have to do is keep on 
learning(bugging your nerdier buddies) more about it

to be able to unlock more and more things 
as you may like the idea of having 
your own connections and nodes ect.

but thats completley up to you.

## So how do i use this App now? you ask,(for Grandma)

Go and install it if you have not yet done it,
(and check if theres a new Version from time to time)
and start it.

## Preparing the APP after Installation

The Technical Guide can be consumed later 
from the Menu, go to Preferences now.

There you can change your username,
the rest is good to know where it is,
but can be left untouched.

Now go to the Menu Connectivity and activate TCP/IP.
When this is all done,shut down the app from the Menu
And restart it again

Now,youll be connected to the RNS Testnet 
and have sent your first Announce at Restart.

To do this on demand you go to the Menu Conversations
and simply Click the first button from the left 
(on the right top)

Good,Tell friends what Announce to look for 
instead of the lxmf adress(number)

In fact this Menu is an important part of the App 
as all users will be sending Announces,
where you can watch and decide to start interacting,
when your friends will come onboard,
you will see their Announces or they see yours 
and voila,thats all thats needed to start using the App.

All it takes is a little time and more and more Announces are listed,
so at start patience is needed in discovering 
foreign Nodes and Peers in the Wild,

soon you will have lists and contacts if you use the App,
(which looks bare at start)you can edit/manage them there.

# Now is the time to tell your Friends about it.

Of course there can be more things made,
but for beginners its all that is needed to use it.

# Our hope

We hope youll find this inspiring enough for you 
to decide to think about your own connections 
and souvreign infrastructure and Networks.

From testing this new way of Networking to having 
a safe secure independent solution even for emergency 
scenarios 

is then merly a small hobby project away 
from anyone intrested to achieve or provide.
And we are there to assist.

Please spread the word and support our efforts,
thank you very much
